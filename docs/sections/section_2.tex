Ship detection is a relevant social and enforcement to attent a myriad of problems, like piracy, illegal maritime trafic, and UII fishing.
A complete set of literature have used different ship detection algorithms and different sources of geospatial data. For instance, \citeA{Tello2005} 
uses satellite-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to capture spectral signals of vessels in the ocean. The use of SAR data to this task is 
common in the literature \cite{Margarit2009, Brusch2011, Corbane2008, Paes2010}.\footnote{Most of these documents rely on the \textit{TerraSAT} 
data which have a resolution up to $\approx$ 16 meters.} The extensive use of SAR data is due to the advantages of radar data in adverse weather
conditions, and higher cloud coverage, which is a downside of visible satellite imagery.
