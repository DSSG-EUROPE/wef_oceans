Data science is increasingly being applied to optimise, or improve operations in business and industry. There is also a movement gaining popularity to apply data science approaches to solve problems relating to social good, for example in environmental, healthcare, or government services. A framework is here outlined that demonstrates an approach to improve detection of illegal, unregulated, and unreported (IUU) fishing using multiple data sources. Automatic identification system (AIS) data was used to predict whether a vessel is fishing, and generate components to indicate the likelihood of a vessel engaging in IUU behaviours. These AIS data were then correlated with satellite imagery and vessel images extracted. This document describes the data sources relevant to this problem, the approach taken, as well as evaluation of our methods, and future work.
